# KeyAuth-UserVariable
Simple user variable application. If the variable exists it will display it, it if does not exist then it will create a new user variable then display it. Very easy to follow along. 


## Seller Subscription Required for this method

I made this because I was bored and had nothing else to do... it is pretty straight forward and believe I explained everything that happens in the code so users can understand it better. Remember that this example gets/sets the data while unauthenticated! Make sure when you create your webhooks you uncheck authenticated or it won't work. This can be implemented in your own project easily if you wish to do so and can be used w/ multiple variables as well, you can either just copy and paste the method over and over or create a function to handle all parmas if you know how to do so. If you need help feel free to message me. If you have suggestions let me know.
